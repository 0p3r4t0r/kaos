## About
Kaos is a browser based game written using the
[Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API),
[Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API),
and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). It was written by two brothers as a project to
pass the time during quarantine. It features 3 different game modes and supports
multiple input mediums.

## Mechanics
Each side of the canvas emits orbs of a different color, traveling in straight
paths to the respecively opposite sides of the canvas. If the player collides
with an orb of a different color than their own, the game ends. The player must
move, rotate, and change their color in order to gather points.

## Game Modes
1. Timed: Points are collected by surviving for as long as possible.
2. Spin2Win: Points are collected by completing 360 degree rotations.
3. Collector: Points are collected by colliding with orbs of the same color as
the player.
